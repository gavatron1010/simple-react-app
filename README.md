This simple React app includes authentication with Google OAuth, Webpack setup with Babel + Typescript, state management with Redux + Sagas and a React Portal.

You will need to register the application with a Google Developer account and generate OAuth credentials.
Add your client id credential to the AuthButton component as the clientId prop to the GoogleLogin component.
